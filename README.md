##Some other words

I tried multiple editors to write markdown, both local and online, and finally decided to write all my files on [stackedit][1]. Additionally, to solve the problem that GitHub doesn't support formulas written in LaTex, I used [latex.codecogs.com][2] to edit the formulas and publish them in my docs as pictures. This is not as good as writing directly in LaTex but might as well do the job. Here is a sample:

#Assignment6

##Work that's been done so far

* Finished class `shell` to calculate the trajectory of a cannon shell with known firing angle and initial velocity.
* Added methods for `shell` to plot the dependence of x to y.
* Began writing a class `shell_firing` to calculate the firing angle and initial velocity of the shell to hit a particular target.

##Work to be done

* Finish class `shell_firing`.
* Add methods to `shell_firing` to include uncertainty in the calculation.
